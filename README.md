## To run:


`$ npm install` 

For iOS:

```
$ react-native run-ios
```
For Android:
```
$ react-native run-android
```

If you get an error while building that says "something" you need to follow the following steps:

- cd into your folder AwsomeProject and run the following in your terminal:

```
cd android
touch local.properties
cd ..
```

- open up the local.properties file and copy & paste `sdk.dir = /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.4.1_1`

- cd back into AwsomeProject and run `react-native run-android`

##AppRegistry
AppRegistry is much like `reactDOM.render()` but AppRegistry looks like this:
`AppRegistry.registerComponent('WHAT YOU NAMED YOUR PROJECT', () => ReactComponent);`

## Elements
##### `<div\> = < View \>`
They work the same in both web and React-Native 

##### `<p\> =  < Text \>`
They work the same in both web and React-Native

##### `<img\> =  < Image \>`
Image tags In react native take a few properties today we will be working with source and style

##### Network Image

```
<Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} style={{width: 400, height: 400}} /\>
```

Unlike with static resources, you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image.

#####Static resource

```
<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} /\>
```

Image tags can only accept `.png` images

##### `background image= <Image\> </Image\>`
Background Images work just like an Image tag but are just not self closing any elements between them will display on top of your picture.

##### `<input\> = <TextInput/\>`

##### `<ul\> = <ListView/\>`
This is a little more difficult than most becuase this does not work like your normal `<ul\> `we will get back to this after we cover state.
